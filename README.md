# Manipulator Learning Testbed

## General Configuration

The following image illustrates the manipulator configuration, where you can clearly see the ID and name assigned to each motor. Please note the voltage and bps for this configuration too. Please ***do not change the ID settings and the communication speed*** so we can all work under the same parameters
