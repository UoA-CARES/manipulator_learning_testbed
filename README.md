# Manipulator Learning Testbed

## General Configuration

The following image illustrates the manipulator configuration, where you can clearly see the ID and name assigned to each motor. Please note the voltage and bps for this configuration too. Please ***do not change the ID settings and the communication speed*** so we can all work under the same parameters

## Materials  
In order to have an exact replication of the robot used in this proposal, you will need the following materials, we also provide the STL files for 3d printer:

|Material      | Brand| Quantity|
|--------------|------|---------|
| ServoMotors  | Dynamixel XL-320| 4  |
| WebCam  | Standard| 1  |
| STL Files  |   | [link](https://github.com/UoA-CARES/manipulator_learning_testbed/tree/main/Fully%20actuated%20Gripper%20STL)   |
| USD2 PHB|Dynamixel | 1 |
| U2D2 INT|Dynamixel | 1 |
